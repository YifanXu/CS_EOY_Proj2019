"OH NO! Where should xxx go???" - a guide v1.0

All files, except those that already exists, should be in one of the four folders. The files are
-OrganizationHelp
-LICENSE
-README
-.gitignore

The division of folders is outlined as follows
BUILDS - All builds, devBuilds or release builds should be in this folder and outlined as such
DESIGN - All design documents such as specs, project time table, etc should be in this folder (bascially all the PM stuff)
PROJECTS - Directory for all unity projects, including main project and test projects. The latest release must be marked as [LATEST STABLE]
MISC - Everything else that does not appeal to a specific category 

Add explanation on what is in the folders in the directory txt file for each folder.

**PLEASE PUSH ALL DEVELOPMENT TO PERSONAL DEV BRANCHES. DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER**
All changes must be presented in the following order
Local -> Personal Branch -> Dev Branch -> Master
